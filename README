This repository contains several extension APIs for ComputerCraft.
The main focus is to provide networking, and advanced turtle navigation.
The files can be added to an existing ComputerCraft installation.
The only file overwritten will be bios.lua.  This is to add two lines
that initialize the advanced API loader and the dispatcher.  You may
need to adapt to newer versions of the bios.

Overview of files:
