This repository contains several extension APIs for ComputerCraft.
The main focus is to provide networking, and advanced turtle navigation.
The files can be added to an existing ComputerCraft installation.
The only file overwritten will be bios.lua.  This is to add two lines
that initialize the advanced API loader and the dispatcher.  You may
need to adapt to newer versions of the bios.

Overview of files:

Directory /
  bios.lua      - additions to initialize API loader and dispatcher
  start.lua     - auxiliary loader to run unit tests in regular lua outside Minecraft

Directory /rom/apis
  loader        - advanced API loader that supports dependencies between APIs
  lunit         - minimal unit testing framework
  lua52         - provide functionality missing from lua 5.1

Directory /rom/apis/advanced - Basic APIs
  autotable     - table that automatically initializes entries on first access
  dispatcher    - distributes osEvents to parties that have registered
  event         - redirect a call to all registered handlers
  persistency   - store a table persistently in a file
  serializer    - improved serializer (correct string handling, arrays)
  table         - table utilities (clone)
  timer         - abstraction of timer/alarm for multiple users
  transformation- linear transformations on vectors
  vectorx       - advaned vectors based on arrays
  iterator      - working with sequences
  func          - manipulating functions
  volume        - map from vectors to values

  routingtable  - routing logic for network stack
  galileo       - European GPS (running in background with forwarding)
  turtleplus    - adds hooks to turtle API and updates position API
  turtlesensor  - sense envirenment as turtle moves
  position      - API to maintain position of computer / turtle
  worldmap      - records turtlesensor results
  navigator     - navigate to a destination avoiding obstacles

Directory /rom/programs
  galileo       - service program for getting status / configuring galileo API
  netdump       - listen to network traffic
  netstat       - show routing table
  ping          - test network connectivity

Directory /rom/programs/turtle
